# Computational Intelligence
This repo presents my version of solutions for solving the problems in computational intelligence course. 

The following topics are covered:
* CVXPY to solve linear regression, fuzzy regression, and SVR
* Implementations from scratch:
  *  A* algorithm
  *  Simulated Annealing
  *  Tabu search
  *  Genetic Algorithm (GA)
  *  Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACO)
  *  Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO)
  *  Neural Networks
